# Do Read!!!

### Goal 1
The reader should like it. If you don’t like it or you find something is missing, do connect with me and let me know. There is always room to grow.

### Goal 2
I aim to cover or at least direct you , which will help you understand everything from “writing a code”, “structuring our logic” and “working of our logic on hardware”.

### Goal 3
No pre-requisites & No Flow. Keeping it simple, so, I can understand, when I am old & I’ve lost memory.

### Goal 3
Language used to understand is “C”. Cuz, it is the closest to hardware and I like it. All languages follow similar pattern.

# Road-map
**“Code” is a set of instructions given to a computer to get defined output while “Code Structure” is set of rules you need follow while writing instructions so it runs as you expect it to.**
